# Final Project

abalone-regression
==============================

> Abalones are sea snails that are prized for their unique meat, beautiful shells, and cultural importance, but their price varies significantly with age. Traditionally, methods to determine the age of abalone involve laborious tasks like shell cutting, staining, and ring counting under a microscope. Fortunately, machine learning offers an alternative method to predict the age of abalone using other easier-to-obtain physical measurements, thus saving time and money. The goal is to develop a regression model capable of predicting the age of abalone through various physical measurements.
